## 🔧 Key Changes Made

### 1. **Abstention Logic Completely Removed**
- `should_abstain()` function now always returns `False`
- All confidence threshold checks removed
- All excerpt count checks removed
- **Result**: Every verse with commentaries will generate a summary

### 2. **Per-Verse AI Summaries**
- Each verse gets its own combined summary
- Synthesizes all commentaries for that specific verse
- No more overall summaries across all results

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Clear debug messages for each verse processing
- Shows commentary count and school count
- Identifies specific failure reasons (if any)

## 🎯 What You Get Now

### Before (with abstention):
```
Processing verse 14:15 with 4 commentaries from 4 schools...
✅ Verse 14:15: Summary generated successfully

Processing verse 14:14 with 4 commentaries from 4 schools...
❌ Verse 14:14: Confidence too low after hybrid scoring: 0.000

Processing verse 1:35 with 3 commentaries from 3 schools...
❌ Verse 1:35: Confidence too low after hybrid scoring: 0.000

Result: Generated summaries for 1 out of 3 verses!
```

### After (no abstention):
```
Processing verse 14:15 with 4 commentaries from 4 schools...
✅ Verse 14:15: Summary generated successfully

Processing verse 14:14 with 4 commentaries from 4 schools...
✅ Verse 14:14: Summary generated successfully

Processing verse 1:35 with 3 commentaries from 3 schools...
✅ Verse 1:35: Summary generated successfully

Result: Generated summaries for 3 out of 3 verses!
```
